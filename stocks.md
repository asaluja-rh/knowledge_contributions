AI Stocks: Tech Giants, Cloud Titans Build 2025 Momentum
========================================================

Is the artificial intelligence stock market boom still wired or tired? Top AI stocks such as **Microsoft** ([MSFT](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MSFT)) and **Nvidia** ([NVDA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=NVDA)) face high expectations. For many companies — such as Google parent **Alphabet** ([GOOGL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=GOOGL)), **Amazon.com** ([AMZN](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AMZN)) and Facebook parent **Meta Platforms** ([META](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=META)) — the rise of generative AI poses both risk and opportunity.

But think about a few decades backHow the dawn of the internet0 seconds of 15 secondsVolume 0% 

Amid the emergence of [generative AI](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/chatgpt-is-just-the-tip-of-the-iceberg-in-content-creating-artificial-intelligence-get-ready-for-a-lot-of-disruption/) — which can generate text, images, and video — it's a good time to be cautious amid the hype. Many companies suddenly tout AI product roadmaps. In general, look for AI stocks that use artificial intelligence to improve products or gain a strategic edge.

Key Issues For Top AI Stocks
----------------------------

Meanwhile, capital spending has boomed at cloud computing giants Amazon, Microsoft and Google as well Meta Platforms. Tech giants are spending heavily on [data center infrastructure](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/vertiv-stock-amphenol-celestica-q3-earnings/), such as AI chips and servers, as well as research and development.

Amid increased capital spending by cloud computing giants, the big question is how much incremental AI-related revenue they're getting. The cloud giants in the September quarter notched [revenue growth for the fourth straight quarter](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/tech-giants-see-ai-bets-starting-to-pay-off-278796f6), indicating that AI investments may be paying off.

"Overall, Q3 results continue to reaffirm that customers have shifted their focus from cloud cost optimization back to modernizing their workloads for AI," said Jefferies analyst Brent Thill in a report.

At Evercore ISI, analyst Kirk Materne said in a report: "Cloud revenue growth remains healthy with AWS (sales) accelerating 19%, Google Cloud accelerating to 35% and Microsoft Azure (consumption) growing at 34%," he said. "While AI capacity constraints are limiting near-term acceleration for Azure and AWS, we believe the aggregate bookings growth continues to indicate that customers are making big bets on cloud growth and this bodes well for 2025 revenue growth."

Will Apple Intelligence Deliver?
--------------------------------

Also, **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) has been one of the top AI stocks to watch. Apple stock has gained 16% in 2024. The big question is whether Apple Intelligence features in iPhone 16 models will spur a big upgrade cycle.

"The step by step rollout of Apple Intelligence (China likely in April) will result in a strong December quarter but will also flow into the March and June quarters which should be good news for 2025," said Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives in a report.

Chipmaker Nvidia has been a bellwether for AI stocks. [Nvidia stock](https://www.investors.com/research/nvda-stock-is-nvidia-a-buy-2/) has climbed  jumped 173% in 2024 after surging 239% last year. Further, Nvidia stock remains on the [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leaders). For Nvidia, ramping up production of next-generation Blackwell AI chips in 2025 will be key.

AI Stocks Now A 'Show Me' Story
-------------------------------

The best AI stocks to buy span chipmakers, software companies, cloud computing service providers and technology giants.

What's clear is that AI stocks are under more scrutiny.

"We expect AI to transition from a 'tell me' to a 'show me' story, with any disconnect between investments and revenue generation to come under increased scrutiny," said a Bank of America report. "

Facebook-parent Meta is among the top AI stocks to watch. [Meta stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/meta-stock-facebook-buy-now/) has gained 60% in 2024.

Meanwhile, Nvidia and **Arista Networks** ([ANET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANET)) are squaring off in the [AI Ethernet networking market](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/nvidia-stock-arista-networks-ai-networking-battle/). Also, Arista stock has gained 67% in 2024.

Arista stock ranks No.30 in the [IBD 50 roster of growth stocks](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) while Palantir stock ranks No. 16.

Software Makers Pivot to AI Agents
----------------------------------

So far, the biggest demand for AI chips has come from cloud computing giants and internet companies.

**Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)), Qualcomm, **ARM Holdings** ([ARM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARM)), and **Marvell Technologies** ([MRVL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRVL)) are other AI chipmakers to watch. Broadcom and Marvell make custom AI chips for cloud computing giants.

In general, semiconductor plays have out-performed software companies as the best AI stocks.

Many software companies, meanwhile, have yet to monetize AI products. One big issue for software companies is how fast customers ramp up pilot programs to commercial deployment.

Having struggled to generate new revenue from "copilots," software companies are now turning to [AI agents](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/nvidia-stock-ai-agents-software-companies/).

Meanwhile, data analytics software maker **Palantir** ([PLTR](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=PLTR)) has bucked the trend that chipmakers are the best AI stocks. [PLTR stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/pltr-stock-buy-now/) has gained 144% this year. Q3 earnings for Palantir stock are due Nov. 4.

Also, for most big application software companies, how to charge for AI-related products has been an issue.

Further, most enterprise software makers will not monetize generative AI, or "conversational AI,"  in a material way until late 2025, some analysts say. Many U.S. companies are pursuing custom AI software development projects, which will take longer to ramp up commercially.

Also, AI technology uses computer algorithms. The software programs aim to mimic the human ability to learn, interpret patterns and make predictions.

Until recently, machine learning was largely limited to models that processed data to make predictions. The AI models focused on pattern recognition from existing data. Corporate spending on AI projects was modest as companies mulled return on investment.

AI Stocks To Watch By Industry Group
------------------------------------

New generative AI models process "prompts," such as internet search queries, that describe what a user wants to get. Generative AI technologies create text, images, video and computer programming code on their own.

Companies will aim to boost productivity by developing customized AI for specific industries. Proprietary company data will be used to train AI models.

AI systems require massive computing power to find patterns and make inferences from large quantities of data. So the race is on to build AI chips for data centers, self-driving cars, robotics, smartphones, drones and other devices.

For chipmakers, analysts expect a market for "edge AI" — on-device processing of AI apps to emerge.

While "training" AI models is now the biggest market for chipmakers like Nvidia, the market will shift to "[inferencing](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/ai-stocks-market-shifting-to-inferencing-from-training/)," or running AI applications, in the long run.

Will AI Startups Challenge Tech Giants
--------------------------------------

What's more, one key question for investors is whether tech industry incumbents will be the big generative AI winners. Or, will a new wave of AI startups eventually dominate? OpenAI has told employees its now on an annual revenue run-rate of $3.4 billion, up from $2 billion in January.

OpenAI has raised $6.6 billion in new funding, [valuing the startup at $157 billion](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/nvidia-stock-microsoft-stock-openai-funding-valuation/), up from $86 billion early this year. The new round was led by venture-capital firm Thrive Capital. Microsoft again invested. New investors include SoftBank and Nvidia but not Apple as rumored.

OpenAI plans to convert from a nonprofit organization to a for-profit company as top researchers continue to leave.

Further, OpenAI has released a new large language training model capable of enhanced reasoning skills. Code-named "Strawberry," it's officially called OpenAI o1.

Large language models provide the building blocks to develop applications. Further, LLMs help AI systems understand the way that humans write and speak. Also, LLMs require training data for specific tasks. Companies with access to troves of data hold an edge.

OpenAI is part of a wave of LLM startups that includes AI21 Labs, Anthropic and Cohere. Anthropic introduced Claude 3, the newest version of its chatbot, and claimed its performance is better than OpenAI's GPT-4.

However, OpenAI's dominance faces a [challenge from open-source LLMs](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/generative-ai-battle-forms-should-big-tech-control-its-path/).  Musk's xAI announced it will open source its Grok LLM, and released the source code for public use.
