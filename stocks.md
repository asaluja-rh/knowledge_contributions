Key Issues For Top AI Stocks
----------------------------

OpenAI has raised $6.6 billion in new funding, [valuing the startup at $157 billion](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/nvidia-stock-microsoft-stock-openai-funding-valuation/), up from $86 billion early this year. The new round was led by venture-capital firm Thrive Capital. Microsoft again invested. New investors include SoftBank and Nvidia but not **Apple** ([AAPL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AAPL)) as rumored.

OpenAI plans to convert from a nonprofit organization to a for-profit company as top researchers continue to leave.

Further, OpenAI has released a new large language training model capable of enhanced reasoning skills. Code-named "Strawberry," it's officially called OpenAI o1. The company says  OpenAI o1 outperforms its earlier training model, GPT-4o. But it's more expensive to run than GPT-4o.

Also, Apple has been one of the top AI stocks to watch. Apple stock has gained 18% in 2024. The big question is whether Apple Intelligence features in iPhone 16 models will spur a big upgrade cycle.

Chipmaker Nvidia has been a bellwether for AI stocks. [Nvidia stock](https://www.investors.com/research/nvda-stock-is-nvidia-a-buy-2/) has climbed  jumped 172% in 2024 after surging 239% last year. Further, Nvidia stock remains on the [IBD Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.investors.com/#/leaders/leaders). For Nvidia, ramping up production of next-generation Blackwell AI chips in 2025 will be key.

AI Stocks Now A 'Show Me' Story
-------------------------------

The best AI stocks to buy span chipmakers, software companies, cloud computing service providers and technology giants.

Capital spending boomed in the June quarter at cloud computing giants Amazon, Microsoft and Google. Tech giants are spending heavily on data center infrastructure, such as AI chips and servers, as well as research and development.

Amid increased capital spending by cloud computing giants, the big question is how much incremental AI-related revenue they're getting. What's clear is that AI stocks are under more scrutiny.

"We expect AI to transition from a 'tell me' to a 'show me' story, with any disconnect between investments and revenue generation to come under increased scrutiny," said a Bank of America report. "

Facebook-parent Meta is among the top AI stocks to watch. [Meta stock](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/meta-stock-facebook-buy-now/) has gained 66% in 2024. Also, Meta has launched AI Studio, which enables businesses to build custom AI agents.

Meanwhile, Nvidia and **Arista Networks** ([ANET](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ANET)) are squaring off in the [AI Ethernet networking market](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/nvidia-stock-arista-networks-ai-networking-battle/). Also, Arista stock has gained 77% in 2024.

Arista stock ranks No. 15 in the [IBD 50 roster of growth stocks](https://research.investors.com/stock-lists/ibd-50/) while Palantir stock ranks No. 6.

AI Stocks: Software Monetization An Issue
-----------------------------------------

So far, the biggest demand for AI chips has come from cloud computing giants and internet companies.

**Broadcom** ([AVGO](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=AVGO)), Qualcomm, **ARM Holdings** ([ARM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=ARM)), and **Marvell Technologies** ([MRVL](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=MRVL)) are other AI chipmakers to watch. Broadcom and Marvell make custom AI chips for cloud computing giants.

Also, for most big application software companies, how to charge for AI-related products has been an issue.

Further, most enterprise software makers will not monetize generative AI, or "conversational AI,"  in a material way until late 2025, some analysts say. Many U.S. companies are pursuing custom AI software development projects, which will take longer to ramp up commercially.

Also, AI technology uses computer algorithms. The software programs aim to mimic the human ability to learn, interpret patterns and make predictions.

Until recently, machine learning was largely limited to models that processed data to make predictions. The AI models focused on pattern recognition from existing data. Corporate spending on AI projects was modest as companies mulled return on investment.
